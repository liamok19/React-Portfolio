      <p >Aloha, I'm Liam, Li, Leeham and my list of nicknames continues to grow. I worked in Visual FX and Animation for over 8 years and have a wealth of experience managing productions involving Artists, Directors, Admin, Production, and Marketing team members. Web Development is a skill I would like to expand.</p> 
      <p>A fabulous thing about me is that I have traded dancing on stage for dancing in the kitchen. Despite the fact that it has no relevance to programming, it contributes to the upbeat nature I bring to the working environment.</p>
          </div>
